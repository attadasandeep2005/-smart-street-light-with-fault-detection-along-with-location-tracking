<ul>
<li><b>Vehicle and Light Intensity Detection:</b> The system could be equipped with sensors such as radar or infrared to detect approaching vehicles. Additionally, light intensity sensors can gauge the ambient light level. Based on this data, the system can adjust the brightness of the street lights accordingly to conserve energy while ensuring sufficient illumination.</li>
<li><b>Fault Detection System:</b> Each street light could be equipped with self-diagnostic capabilities. Sensors within the light could monitor parameters like power consumption, bulb temperature, and connectivity to the network. If any anomaly is detected, such as a malfunctioning bulb or power supply issue, the system would automatically flag it as a fault.</li>
<li><b>Notification to Admin:</b> When a fault is detected, the system could send an alert to the administrator via email or text message, including details of the specific fault and the location of the affected street light. This allows for quick response and repair.</li>
<li><b>RFID Tag for Maintenance Tracking:</b> Technicians assigned to repair the faulty street light could use RFID tags or similar technology to log their presence and actions. Each light pole could have an RFID reader integrated into it. When a technician completes a repair, they would swipe their RFID tag to update the system with the time and date of the repair, as well as any actions taken.</li>
<li><b>Centralized Management System:</b> All data collected by the smart street light system, including fault reports and maintenance records, could be stored and managed in a centralized database. This allows administrators to track the status of each street light, monitor maintenance activities, and analyze trends for further optimization.</li>
